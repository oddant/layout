Hello,
This is the starting files of my website structure,
I'd appreciate to have feeds back !
If you want to join me in this project please send me a message.

Where to start ?
	Consider the '.htaccess' file which contains mod_rewrite rules,
	the rules check for the first segment of the path and the second respectively referring to the language and the path to the content to load (e.g. the page).

	The 'struct.php' file is where all the magic happens,
	it handles the GET variable sent from the mod_rewrite directives and load the common parts shared between all the webpages of the site.

What is my request ?
	I feel comfortable with this structure but since I'm new to mod_rewrite and I'm used to work single on my projects, I'd like to share with people in order to learn more about each methods and ways of creating website layouts.
